# Megaline Project
Megaline is a telecommunications operator company that provides prepaid telecommunications and internet packages. This company offers its clients two types of prepaid plans, namely the Surf plan and the Ultimate plan. The advertising department wants to know which prepaid plan generates more revenue, so they can create an advertising budget accordingly. From the existing data, an initial analysis was carried out for these prepaid packages based on a relatively small sample of clients. The data held is 500 Megaline client data, which contains information such as: who they are, where they come from, what type of package they use, and the number of calls and messages they sent in 2018. The main task is to analyze user behavior, then determine which prepaid package is more profitable.

## The objectives of this analysis include:
- Know client behavior with different packages.
- Comparing both prepaid plans.
- Analyze which prepaid plan is more profitable.
- Testing the hypothesis of the average income of existing packages and the average income of users from 2 different regions
